Click-Click is a fun and addictive game designed to test a user's reflexes and response time. The objective of the game is to click an arrow that randomly appears in a designated area. If the user successfully clicks the arrow ten times in a row then they win the game. However, if the user fails to find and click the arrow, then they lose the game. The user has all the control as to how quickly they can win the game. 

The game was designed with a user's experience in mind. With simplistic and intuitive design, the game is both easy to learn and enjoyable to play. The user can challenge themselves as they can set their own pace and difficulty, which will sharpen their reflexes and response times.
